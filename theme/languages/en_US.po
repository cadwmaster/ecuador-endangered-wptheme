"Your money will also help fund a publicity campaign with the coalition of Ecuadorian civil society groups, demanding an open dialogue on development. This will focus on 'Extractivism vs Sustainability' and will show how development models based on conservation, biodiversity, renewable energy and human potential are better for everyone. Costa Rica banned all open-pit mining in 2010 and today has much better socioeconomic indicators than Ecuador."
